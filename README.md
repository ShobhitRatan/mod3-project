# Flatflix

A netflix clone, built with React frontend and Rails backend, which allows users to sign in and watch trailers of their favorite movies.

_Made by [Shobhit Ratan](https://github.com/ShobhitRatan) and [Kyle Tomanelli](https://github.com/ktomanelli) for their Flatiron School Mod 3 project._

## How It Works

Flatiron Tetris is a JavaScript based Tetris game. A user can use the arrow keys to move a falling piece any up, down, left, or right. And space bar to rotate a piece to better fit the Tetris landscape.

## Built Using?

Flatiron Tetris was built using Rails on the backend which handles storing and randomly selecting the default coordinates for available pieces, and Vanilla JavaScript on the frontend which handles displaying the backend-provided coordinates on the 2-dimensional array Tetris grid.
